# Web User Analytics Readme

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of web user analytics data. The dataset includes various metrics such as sessions, users, bounce rate, pageviews, conversion rate, transactions, revenue, quantity sold, and average session duration. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and linear regression modeling.

## Importing Libraries <a name="importing-libraries"></a>
- Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Reading the DataFrame <a name="reading-the-dataframe"></a>
- The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame.

## Data Processing <a name="data-processing"></a>
- Data processing steps include converting string columns to numeric, converting time strings to seconds, and handling missing values.

## EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis <a name="eda---exploratory-data-analysis"></a>
- Exploratory data analysis includes examining data distributions, calculating summary statistics, checking for missing values, and visualizing trends over time and across different metrics.

## Visualization <a name="visualization"></a>
- Visualizations are created to better understand trends, distributions, and relationships between variables in the dataset.

## Hypothesis Testing <a name="hypothesis-testing"></a>
- Several hypotheses are tested using statistical methods such as t-tests, chi-square tests, normality tests, and correlation tests.

## Linear Regression <a name="linear-regression"></a>
- Linear regression models are built to predict revenue based on various predictor variables such as transactions, quantity sold, pageviews, sessions, new users, and users. Model performance and significance of predictor variables are evaluated.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into web user behavior and factors influencing revenue generation. It can be used to optimize marketing strategies, improve website usability, and drive business growth.
